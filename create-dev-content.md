# How to start writing developer docs as a sole technical writer

When you're a sole technical writer in a company, you write documentation for installers, end-users, administrators, and maybe even developers.  For some of us, writing for developers might be a new challenge. I put together this guide to help you get started writing developer docs. 

## 1. Investigate why your organization needs developer docs

Ask your product team and your dev team what they want to gain by adding developer content. What problems are they trying to solve? Here are some possible questions you can ask:

- How are external developers using the product today?
- Is there a need to reduce work for the implementation teams that are installing the product? What are the main problems?
- Are there existings docs, but there are still a lot of support calls? If yes, what are the issues?

## 2. Understand the vision

What is the vision for the developer product, and how does the documentation fit into this vision? Let's say that the vision is to let developers add your product to their app. You'll probably need to deliver: API reference docs, tutorials to use the endpoints together, SDK docs, and testing guidelines.  (link to review of different types of developer documentation)

Ask questions, and make sure you understand what you need to write.

## 3. Prioritize the doc issues with the product and dev teams

Now that you have a good understanding of what problems your docs need to help solve and the vision for the developer product, map out your documentation tasks. Does one task depend on another? Is there an order to do them? For example...

After you have a map of what needs to be done, ask your dev and product teams for feedback, and ask them to prioritize what must come first.

## 4. Identify your own knowledge gaps

Writing for developers can be challenging for those of us that aren't engineers. What do you need to learn? You don't need to be able to code. But you do need to be familiar with the developer's environment. These are the basics that I recommend:
- a
- b
- c
- d
Give yourself an hour or so to learn a little bit every week. If you want links to resources, DM me.

## 5. Pick the best authoring tool for your team
## 6. Create a simple style guide 
## 7. Set up regular syncs with your dev and product teams
## 8. Set up a process for documentation development and release
## 9. Ask for feedback from everyone
